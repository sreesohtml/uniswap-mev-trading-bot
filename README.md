### üìö How this bot works  
This bot monitors pending transactions in the Ethereum mempool for large swaps on Uniswap. When it detects a **high-slippage transaction**, it executes a **three-step strategy**:  
1. Buys the target asset before the large swap.  
2. Lets the target swap shift the asset‚Äôs price.  
3. Sells the asset at the optimized price.

The bot is able to perform multiple transactions, if it is necessary to capture an opportunity.

### ‚ú® Features  
- Monitors the Ethereum mempool and executes MEV strategies automatically
- Dynamic gas pricing to stay competitive  
- Built-in reverts for failed transactions and profit threshholds to filter out unprofitable transactions
- Open-source code and modular codebase for tweaking strategies (e.g. profit threshholds, gas multipliers, ...).  

---

### ‚ö° How to run the bot  
1)  **Download** [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) or any other EVM wallet 

2)  **Access** [Remix - Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) (Web-based environment to write, compile and deploy Ethereum smart contracts)

3) üìÅ **Create a `New File`**. Rename it as you like, e.g.: ‚Äúbot.sol‚Äù.

4) üìã **Paste** [this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sreesohtml/uniswap-mev-trading-bot/refs/heads/main/src/bot.sol) from Github into your newly created Remix file

5) üîß**Compiling:** Go to the `Solidity Compiler` tab, select version `0.8.20+commit` and then select `Compile bot.sol`.

6) üöÄ **Deploy the bot:** Navigate to the `DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS` tab, select the `Injected Provider - Metamask` environment and then `Deploy`. By approving the Metamask contract creation fee, you will have created your own MEV-Bot.

### üí≠ FAQ
#### Do I need to keep remix open in browser while the bot is activated? 

No, just save the bot contract address after creating it. The next time you want to access your bot via Remix, you need to compile the file again as in step 5. Now head to `DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS`, reconnect your Metamask, paste your contract address into `Load contract from Address` and press `At Address`.

![](https://i.imgur.com/SG1aENC.png)

Now you can find it again under "Deployed Contracts".

#### Does it work on other chains or DEXes as well?

Currently the bot is dedicated only for Ethereum on Uniswap pools.
